                &lt;text&gt;In public law, there is a sophisticated literature on the role of the judges when they are applying tests such as reasonableness and proportionality. It is generally thought that, in certain types of case, the judges should show 'deference'-although 'self-restraint' is probably a better term-to the initial decision-maker's approach to the issues. This self-restraint might be warranted because, for example, the initial decision-maker is more of an expert on the issues than is the Administrative Court judge, or because the initial decision-maker has democratic support for his or her decision. Of course, these arguments are controversial and there is a considerable debate, both in the literature and in the cases themselves, about when and to what extent the judges should exercise self-restraint.&lt;/text&gt;
            &lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;emph typestyle="it"&gt;FTAs are treaties between state entities or between state
                    entities and independent economic entities that are recognised by the WTO. Most
                    governments believe that such treaties are meant to be enforceable only between
                    the contracting parties, and that private parties are not entitled to enforce
                    their treaty rights. Some FTAs confer on private investors the right to direct
                    remedies in relation to their investments. The author argues that if certain
                    direct remedies can be given to investors in FTAs as a practice under the
                    Washington Convention, it is also fair and feasible from a &amp;amp;#8217;New Haven
                    perspective to extend such protection to private parties in other areas covered
                    by FTAs, such as market access and other privileges given to goods, services and
                    suppliers, or the right to information as provided in FTAs, where such
                    protection is necessary and justified. &lt;/emph&gt;
            &lt;/text&gt;

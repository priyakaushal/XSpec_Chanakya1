    <p>Throughout the landing page documents the same Rosetta element is often used to mark-up a
      variety of different semantics in the source landing page documents, and different Rosetta
      elements are used to mark-up the same semantic construct. This is often the case with certain
        <sourcexml>table</sourcexml>, <sourcexml>l</sourcexml>, and <sourcexml>p</sourcexml>
      elements. As such, the same source elements map to different NewLexis target elements
      depending on what type of landing page document they occur in and their particular xpath
      within that type of landing page document. </p>

    <p>Scenarios described by the topics in this section provide for special conversions that are
      required to address the mapping of certain Rosetta mark-up to specific New Lexis mark-up based
      on the starting characters (prefixes) of source document identifier values
        (<sourcexml>docinfo:doc-id</sourcexml>) as well as other context sensitive clues within the
      source documents. </p>

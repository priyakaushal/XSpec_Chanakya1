  <!-- Note: 
    There is a schematron rule that warns about this short descriptin being a bit too long. However, in DITA the recommendation is also to avoid having a topic body containing only a single paragraph of merely 2 or 3 sentences. So, it was decided that the lesser of evils is to make this a short description rather than a body with a short paragraph.

  <shortdesc>The topics in this part of the document contain conversion instructions for common source document elements. Due to the general nature of their wording, these instructions may inadvertently conflict on occaision with the specific instructions for this content stream given in previous parts of this CI. In general, if there is any conflict between instructions in this "General Mark-Up" part of the CI and any previous part, the instructions in the previous part should always take precedence.</shortdesc>

					&lt;case:judgmentbody&gt; &lt;pgrp&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;text&gt; By the
					Housing Act 1925, s 64, power to acquire landcompulsorily is conferred
					upon local authorities. That section provides that a local authority
					may be authorised to purchase land compulsorily for the purpose of
					part III of the Act by means of an order submitted to the Minister and
					confirmed by him in accordance with sched III of the Act. That section
					has been amended, but the substance of it remains. Under that section
					the Sunderland Corporation made an order by which they proposed to
					acquire compulsorily land in Durham Road, belonging to Mr Allen Horn,
					consisting of some 102 acres. Part of that land they desired for the
					purpose of building houses and part of it they desired for the purpose
					of enlarging a public park. There was a point originally raised in the
					notice of appeal to the effect that under this procedure, there was no
					power in the corporation to acquire land for the purpose of a public
					park. That point has been abandoned, and abandoned in this case for
					all time. Some day it may have to be decided. It does not fall to be
					decided either today, or any day in regard of this particular land and
					this particular corporation and this particular park. &lt;/text&gt;

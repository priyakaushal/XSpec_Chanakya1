                    &lt;text&gt;Held: appeal dismissed. Certificate was properly admissible at trial and
                        at the trial de novo. In some instances of withdrawing one information and
                        laying a second on a new charge, accused would be entitled to object to
                        admissibility of certificates prepared and served at the time the earlier
                        information was in existence. However, in this case, because second
                        information had been based on the same fact situation, Crown had promptly
                        laid the second information, and accused's defence at trial had been based
                        on an argument relating to the adequacy of the description of the solution,
                        accused had had reasonable notice within the meaning of s. 237(5) of the
                        Crown's intention to use the certificate at both the trial and trial de
                        novo.&lt;/text&gt;
                &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/case:priorhist&gt;
        &lt;/case:headnote&gt;

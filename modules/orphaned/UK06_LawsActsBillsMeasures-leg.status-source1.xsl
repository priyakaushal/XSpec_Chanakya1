   &lt;nl/&gt;Whereas of late our lord the King, in the quinzim of Saint John Baptist, the sixth year of his reign, calling together the prelates, earls, barons, and his council at Gloucester, and considering that divers of this realm were disherited, by reason that in many cases, where remedy should have been had there was none provided by him nor his predecessors, ordained certain statutes right necessary and profitable for his realm, whereby the people of England and Ireland, being subjects unto his power, have obtained more speedy justice, in their oppressions, than they had before; and certain cases, wherein the law failed, did remain undetermined, and some remained to be enacted, that were for the reformation of the oppressions of the people: Our lord the King in his Parliament, after the feast of Easter, holden the thirteenth year of his reign at Westminster, caused many oppresions of the people, and defaults of the laws, for the accomplishment of the said Statutes of Gloucester, to be rehearsed, and thereupon did provide certain acts, as shall appear here following.
  &lt;/leg:status&gt;
